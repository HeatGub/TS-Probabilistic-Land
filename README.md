# Probabilistic Land - TypeScript
This project started as a tree generating algorithm, but I added shadows, mountains etc. on top of that because plain background didn't look well. So here it is. This is entirely my code (except few copied lines for things like rgba conversion).

# Overwiew
- Over **50 parameters** to change (perspective, shadows, tree parameters, colors, etc.)
- New set of **random parameters** with each refresh
- Move the **lightsource** to change **shadows** direction
- **Plant the tree** by clicking on the ground
- Cancel tree growing or **remove** it completely (ctrl + z)
